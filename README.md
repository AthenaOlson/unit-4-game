# unit-4-game, GW Bootcamp - jQuery Crystal Collector

### Overview

In this assignment, you'll create another fun and interactive game for web browsers. This time, your app must dynamically update your HTML pages with the jQuery library.

### How The Game Works

    * There are four cyrstals displayed as buttons on the page

    * Crystals are assigned a random value at the start of each game (hidden but viewable for these purposes in the console to test values)

    * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game, which is the goal they must reach

    * In my version of the game (not required by assignment) player must select 'Click to Play' to begin the game

    * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add and increment a value of points to the player's total score

        * The game hides this random value which cannot be determined by the player until she clicks a crystal

       * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the        beginning of the game.

    * The player loses if their score goes above the random number

    * The game restarts when the player clicks "Click to Play!"

        * When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's      score (and score counter) will reset to zero

    * The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game 

    * The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120.

    * Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
